the HALT function, 08 is how you end the program, everything else has to be before halt, for example:
00 ;No operation
08 ;halts the program
This would do nothing then end
This is what not to do:
00 ;No operation but also no halt
This gives error; CPU Fault: IP 0x10000 out of bounds
Another thing to not do is:
00 ;No op
08 ;Halts
00 ;Op after halt
This will infact run but the NOP (00) after halt will not execute, same with anything else after halt.

the POKE function, 01 is when you write something to the memory table,
you need 01 (the poke op), then {addr} eg F0 or 51, then the {data} to write eg 21 which is a "!" in ascii.
for example to poke "!" to memory location 34 it would be:
01 34 21 ;pokes 21 to memory
08 ;halts the program

the NOP function is 00, it is no operation, its mostly used for padding, for example:
01 34 21 ;pokes 21 aka "!" to memory address 34
00 ;no operation, more for padding, not used often
01 35 21 ;pokes 21 again to memory address 35
08 ;halts the program

Now that you know these check out poke.shred and REFRENCE.txt and try making your own program!
